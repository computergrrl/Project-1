# Project-1
#Random Quote Generator

So I'm trying for an "exceeds expectations" grade in this project.

I put my quotes array in a separate file called 'quotes.php' just to
keep things clean. It can be found in the 'inc' folder

I added an extra key to my quotes array called 'quotesfrom'. In that key I
store values pertaining to whether the quote was made by an author, comedian,
musician, etc.  This displays underneath the quote and says "quotes from"
followed by whatever the appropriate value is for that quote.

In order to create a couple of functions that I could use to change the quote and
the background color at the same time (a task which embarrassingly took me longer
to figure out how to do than did the initial project) I had to write some JavaScript
functions which I put in a separate file called 'randomizer.js'. (The page is set to refresh the quote and the color every 10 seconds.) That randomizer.js file can
also be found in the 'inc' folder.

Whew! I think that's everything.  Ok! Here's me crossing my fingers....
